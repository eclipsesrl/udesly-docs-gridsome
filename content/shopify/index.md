# Introduction

The **Udesly Adapter** is a web app that allows you to convert your Webflow theme in order to be used with a different *CMS*.

In this documentation we will cover all the necessary steps in order to prepare your Webflow theme to be used with **Shopify**.

## Why the Adapter?

Webflow has the highest quality possible when it comes to visual design, but Shopify as eCommerce covers way more functionality for your project. Don't choose one, use them both. Power up your projects and give your clients endless possibilities.


## Prerequisites

In order to use the Adapter you have to get an Udesly plan: Adapter (monthly/yearly) or All Access and have at least the [Account *Lite Plan*](https://webflow.com/pricing#account)   of Webflow that is the base plan that allows you to export your projects. You don't need absolutely to buy any Site plan in order to use the Adapter. 


## How it Works?

The **Adapter** converts your Webflow exported files in PHP code and will give you back a .zip file that is ready to be installed in your Shopify.

Your design will be transferred along with your interactions, fonts, images etc... 

Webflow CMS and Ecommerce Elements are used only as **placeholder** and will be filled with the data entries that you have created in Shopify.

*Sounds like Magic right?* ðŸ§™

Well, kind of but not really, you have to help the Adapter to understand how to convert correctly your pages and the dynamic parts of them. But don't worry it's really simple, once you have understood the process it will flow automatically! You just have to add some special *attributes* to some of your Webflow elements and pages.
